# Pastebin
-----------
Pastebin is an online application for storing and sharing text-based data, including programming code, configuration files, and any other text snippets. Users can create "pastes" â€” text entries that are published on the site and assigned a unique URL for access. This makes Pastebin an ideal tool for sharing code and information among developers, technical experts, and any users who need temporary storage or sharing of text data over the Internet. The application supports syntax highlighting for numerous programming languages, facilitating the reading and analysis of code. Pastebin is also used for anonymously publicizing information, making it popular among users worldwide.
